Code used for my thesis on the use of Reinforcement Learning, and Aspen+ ActiveX Automation, in reactor sequence optimization.
The DiscreteCase example can be used as a step-by step example, for the development of a reinforcement learning framework, incorporating Aspen+ Automation
The second case study makes use, of the components defined in the first case study, and presents more realistic case example.
